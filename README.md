### An important message for those of you trading the CommunityNodeToken on the Tron DEX's.

We first created the TRUC token so newcomers to TRON could practice creating wallets and sending tokens. We gave them away to everyone joining our telegram group, and we airdropped them to the TRON community at large. Thousands of participants hold TRUC tokens from this initial distribution.

TRUC's value started on the Bancor exchange when we backed 500 million TRUC with 1000 TRX. There, its value grew as it amassed more than a half million TRX. Our goal has always been steady growth which we did by injecting additional TRUC tokens into the exchange, or buying back TRUC tokens from the market. Now that the price of TRUC has stabilized, we have moved trading to the TRON decentralized exchanges.

Paying rewards to voters has always been a source of contention within the TRON community. Some call it vote buying, others consider it the heart of cryptocurrency staking. One thing we realized was that we were missing an opportunity to accrue our earned Super Representative rewards.

The Community Node SR pays out 95% of our earned rewards back to the voters, leaving 5% which goes toward supporting the price of TRUC on the DEX's.

With the capital we have raised, we vote for the Community Node SR, and with the rewards it brings, the value of TRUC slowly compounds.

Until we become an elected block producer, 100% of our portion of rewards, plus the rewards we earn from our votes, goes toward building the equity backing the TRUC token. As an elected block producer, our payout will drop to 90%, with 5% going to the expense of running a node and 5% continuing to be used to support the price of TRUC.

Other than supporting the price of TRUC, the equity accrued will never be spent, although there are some opportunities for putting it to good use, such as City Uptake's investment plan that bears a higher yield than can be earned from voting. It also might provide the vested capital that would allow us to launch a TRON side-chain.

You could say the price of the TRUC token represents number of votes that Community Node receives. TRUC token's capitalization will increase faster when we as a candidate become more popular. 

The TRUC token is a testament to our long term commitment to the TRON blockchain.
